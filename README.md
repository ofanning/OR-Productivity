# OR-Productivity
A chrome extension developed to help users increase their productivity levels.

General:
As two colleges students, the authors of OR Productivity understand how easy it can be to get distracted by the internet and ignore important assignments or tasks. We hope that with this extension, some of those distractions can be eliminated and producivity levels of the user will rise. We designed this product using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Features:
The three main features are the following:
1. A page that allows the user to block websites of their choice for as long as they desire.
2. A pop-up that allows the user to set a timer to ensure they stay on track.
3. A page with helpful tips in general productivity. 

Set Up:
First you must download the respitory to your laptop. Next, open your chrome extensions page and click "Load Unpacked" and select "OR-Productivity" and upload it. The extension should now be a part of your browser until you remove it. We recommend pinning the extension so that you have easy access to all of the useful features.


Usage:
Once the user has downloaded the extension, they can decide how the want to customize their experience. We recommend by right-clicking to the options tab, and inputting which websites the user wants blocked. Next, check out the "Tips" page that gives the user information on how they can implement small changes to better their productivity. If the user finds themselves needing a break, feel free to click on the "Timer" tab and set a timer to ensure their quick break does not turn into a long distraction.

Acknowledgments:
Owen Fanning came up with the original idea for a productivity project. From there, Rocky Aguirre and Owen worked together to bring this project to life. YouTuber Coding Train helped both Owen and Rocky understand different aspects of the coding languages to overall better the project.
